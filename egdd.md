# Game Name

## Elevator Pitch

*A one sentence pitch for your game. Pretend that your were pitching your game to a executive going to the elevator. You have less than 60 Seconds. Check [this resource](http://www.gameacademy.com/perfecting-indie-games-elevator-pitch/) for more information.*

## Influences (Brief)

- Candy Crush:
  - Medium: Mobile Game
  - Explanation: Candy crush is a simple match-3 puzzle game where you swap candies to match three or more of the same color. The game has similiar gameplay as candy crush.
- Yoshi's Cookie:
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: The game will have similar gameplay to Yoshi's cookie where you have to match rows

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Click on tiles to swap between two tiles
- Having a row or column that has a true boolean will give you points and also delete the tiles
- Each level has a goal that you have to reach to advance to the next stage
- Each level gets more difficult with new boolean logic
- If a player doesn't complete the level in a certain amount of time then they fail and have to retry

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

Introduction to boolean expressions

## Target Audiences

* Students studying computer science or programming at a beginner level
* Anyone seeking to understand basic programming concepts

## Target Contexts

* This would be used in introductory computer science classes teaching boolean expressions

## Learning Objectives

*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.*

- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to identify true or false boolean expressions
- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to apply boolean logic to solve simple programming problems
- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to construct boolean expressions involving logical operators AND, OR, NOT, and XOR

## Prerequisite Knowledge

*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?*

- Players should be familiar with boolean data type
- Players should know simple logic operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Players should have a basic understanding of boolean algebra

## Assessment Measures

A short pre-test and matching post-test should be designed to assess student learning

- Given a boolean expression, identify if the expression evaluates to true or false
- Construct a boolean expression using certain logical operators

# What sets this project apart?

- Unlike most games, this one is designed to specifically teach fundamental programming concepts
- Players interact with boolean expressions through gameplay, reinforcing their understanding

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

This is a one person game. The player clicks on two tiles to swap them

## Player Modes

- Single-player: You repeatedly advance through levels until you reach the end

# Gameplay Objectives

- *Primary Objective #1*:
    - Description: *Description*
    - Alignment: *Describe how this aligns with one or more learning objectives*
- *Primary Objective #2*:
    - Description: *Description*
    - Alignment: *Describe how this aligns with one or more learning objectives*
- *etc.*

# Procedures/Actions

*Describe the control scheme and what actions a user can take in the game.*

# Rules

*What resources are available to the player that they make use of?  How does this affect gameplay? How are these resources finite?*

# Objects/Entities

*What other things are in the world that you need to design? These may or may not directly translate to actual objects and classes.*

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- *Core Gameplay Mechanic #1*: *Describe in 2 paragraphs or less, along with how it generally works*
- *Core Gameplay Mechanic #2*: *Describe in 2 paragraphs or less, along with how it generally works*
- *Core Gameplay Mechanic #3*: *Describe in 2 paragraphs or less, along with how it generally works*

    
## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*

## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

## Story (Brief)

*The Summary or TL;DR version of below*

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

# Assets Needed

## Aethestics

*Give a sense of the aesthetics of your game, the spirit and atmosphere. Use descriptive, evocative words that can help the reader understand the emotional response of your game.*
