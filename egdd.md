# Boolean Bonanza

## Elevator Pitch

Picture a game where players dive into the exciting world of programming through interactive puzzles, focusing specifically on mastering boolean expressions, empowering learners with essential coding skills in a fun and engaging way!

## Influences (Brief)

- Candy Crush:
  - Medium: Mobile Game
  - Explanation: Candy crush is a simple match-3 puzzle game where you swap candies to match three or more of the same color. The game has similiar gameplay as candy crush.
- Yoshi's Cookie:
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: The game will have similar gameplay to Yoshi's cookie where you have to match rows

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Click on tiles to swap between two tiles
- Having a row or column that has a true boolean will give you points and also delete the tiles
- Each level has a goal that you have to reach to advance to the next stage
- Each level gets more difficult with new boolean logic
- If a player doesn't complete the level in a certain amount of time then they fail and have to retry

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

Introduction to boolean expressions

## Target Audiences

* Students studying computer science or programming at a beginner level
* Anyone seeking to understand basic programming concepts

## Target Contexts

* This would be used in introductory computer science classes teaching boolean expressions

## Learning Objectives

*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.*

- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to identify true or false boolean expressions
- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to apply boolean logic to solve simple programming problems
- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to construct boolean expressions involving logical operators AND, OR, NOT, and XOR

## Prerequisite Knowledge

*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?*

- Players should be familiar with boolean data type
- Players should know simple logic operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Players should have a basic understanding of boolean algebra

## Assessment Measures

A short pre-test and matching post-test should be designed to assess student learning

- Given a boolean expression, identify if the expression evaluates to true or false
- Construct a boolean expression using certain logical operators

# What sets this project apart?

- Unlike most games, this one is designed to specifically teach fundamental programming concepts
- Players interact with boolean expressions through gameplay, reinforcing their understanding

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

This is a one person game. The player clicks on two tiles to swap them

## Player Modes

- Single-player: You repeatedly advance through levels until you reach the end

# Gameplay Objectives

- Create true boolean expressions:
    - Description: Complete level-specific goals by creating rows or columns of true boolean expressions. Score more points by getting more rows/columns.
    - Alignment: Reinforces understanding of boolean expressions and operators.
- Unlock new and more challenging levels:
    - Description: Progress through increasingly challenging levels, introducing new boolean logic.
    - Alignment: Provides opportunities to apply and expand knowledge of boolean concepts.


# Procedures/Actions

- Players swap tiles to create rows or columns of true boolean expressions.
- Each level presents specific goals to achieve within a time limit.

# Rules

- Players can swap adjacent tiles to create matches.
- Complete a level by getting the desired score within specified constraints like time limits or move/swap limits 
- Different tiles represent true, false, and logical operators

# Objects/Entities
- Tiles
- Animations/Particles
- Music/SFX
- Navigation Menus

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- Swap Tiles: Players swap tiles to create rows or columns of true boolean expressions, with different tiles representing true, false, and logical operators. An animation will occur on swipe and effects will pop up when the row/column is complete.
- Level Up: Each level presents specific goals to achieve using boolean expressions, introducing new logic and challenges. Each level is randomly generated but offers new challenges such as different boolean operators. There will be more rows and columns as the player progresses
- Time Limit: Time limit adds urgency, encouraging quick thinking and decision-making. 

    
## Feedback

Short Term Feedback:
- "Ding" noises on correct swipes
- Score Indicator (text) showcase how well they are doing in the game

Long Term Feedback:
- Leveling System Will Indicate Long Term Progress
- Visuals that indicate What Level You are (Progress Bar)

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

- An animamtion of a cursor swapping two tiles to show how the swap tiles
- Tutorial that shows how to make completed row/col on a small board (3x3)
- Highlight the on-screen timer during the tutorial mode
- Visual and audio cues indicate successful matches and progress towards level goals.

## Presentation of Content

- Introduce a small interactice tutorial when a new logical operator is added to the level.
- Possible tutorial menu to relearn boolean concepts

## Story (Brief)

Boolean Bonanza challenges players with progressively difficult puzzles, immersing them in the world of boolean expressions. The graphics are fun similar to Candy Crush.
