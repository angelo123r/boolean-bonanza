# Game Name

## Elevator Pitch

*A one sentence pitch for your game. Pretend that your were pitching your game to a executive going to the elevator. You have less than 60 Seconds. Check [this resource](http://www.gameacademy.com/perfecting-indie-games-elevator-pitch/) for more information.*

## Influences (Brief)

- Candy Crush:
  - Medium: Mobile Game
  - Explanation: Candy crush is a simple match-3 puzzle game where you swap candies to match three or more of the same color. The game has similiar gameplay as candy crush.
- Yoshi's Cookie:
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: The game will have similar gameplay to Yoshi's cookie where you have to match rows

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Click on tiles to swap between two tiles
- Having a row or column that has a true boolean will give you points and also delete the tiles
- Each level has a goal that you have to reach to advance to the next stage
- Each level gets more difficult with new boolean logic
- If a player doesn't complete the level in a certain amount of time then they fail and have to retry

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

Introduction to boolean expressions

## Target Audiences

* Students studying computer science or programming at a beginner level
* Anyone seeking to understand basic programming concepts

## Target Contexts

* This would be used in introductory computer science classes teaching boolean expressions

## Learning Objectives

*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.*

- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to identify true or false boolean expressions
- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to apply boolean logic to solve simple programming problems
- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to construct boolean expressions involving logical operators AND, OR, NOT, and XOR

## Prerequisite Knowledge

*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?*

- Players should be familiar with boolean data type
- Players should know simple logic operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Players should have a basic understanding of boolean algebra

## Assessment Measures

A short pre-test and matching post-test should be designed to assess student learning

- Given a boolean expression, identify if the expression evaluates to true or false
- Construct a boolean expression using certain logical operators

# What sets this project apart?

- Unlike most games, this one is designed to specifically teach fundamental programming concepts
- Players interact with boolean expressions through gameplay, reinforcing their understanding

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

This is a one person game. The player clicks on two tiles to swap them

## Player Modes

- Single-player: You repeatedly advance through levels until you reach the end

# Gameplay Objectives

- Create true boolean expressions:
    - Description: Complete level-specific goals by creating rows or columns of true boolean expressions. Score more points by getting more rows/columns.
    - Alignment: Reinforces understanding of boolean expressions and operators.
- Unlock new and more challenging levels:
    - Description: Progress through increasingly challenging levels, introducing new boolean logic.
    - Alignment: Provides opportunities to apply and expand knowledge of boolean concepts.


# Procedures/Actions

- Players swap tiles to create rows or columns of true boolean expressions.
- Each level presents specific goals to achieve within a time limit.

# Rules

- Players can swap adjacent tiles to create matches.
- Complete a level by getting the desired score within specified constraints like time limits or move/swap limits 
- Different tiles represent true, false, and logical operators

# Objects/Entities
- Tiles
- Animations/Particles
- Music/SFX
- Navigation Menus

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- Swap Tiles: Players swap tiles to create rows or columns of true boolean expressions, with different tiles representing true, false, and logical operators. An animation will occur on swipe and effects will pop up when the row/column is complete.
- Level Up: Each level presents specific goals to achieve using boolean expressions, introducing new logic and challenges. Each level is randomly generated but offers new challenges such as different boolean operators. There will be more rows and columns as the player progresses
- Time Limit: Time limit adds urgency, encouraging quick thinking and decision-making. 

    
## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

- An animamtion of a cursor swapping two tiles to show how the swap tiles
- Tutorial that shows how to make completed row/col on a small board (3x3)
- Highlight the on-screen timer during the tutorial mode
- Visual and audio cues indicate successful matches and progress towards level goals.

## Presentation of Content

- Introduce a small interactice tutorial when a new logical operator is added to the level.
- Possible tutorial menu to relearn boolean concepts

## Story (Brief)

Boolean Bonanza challenges players with progressively difficult puzzles, immersing them in the world of boolean expressions. The graphics are fun similar to Candy Crush.

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

# Assets Needed

## Aethestics

- Vibrant visuals with a playful, educational atmosphere.
- Engaging sound effects and music enhancing the gaming experience.

## Graphical

- Characters List
  - No "characters"
  - Tiles representing true, false, and logical operators
- Textures:
  - Playful cube textures for the tile
  - Fun colors similar to Candy Crush
- Environment Art/Textures:
  - Menu graphics
  - Level Map graphics 
  - Background art during levels


## Audio

- Music List (Ambient sound)
  - In Game Music: Ambient music to accompany gameplay, increases pace as time runs out
  - Main menu music: Fun, 8-bit style music when player is in main menu/choosing a level
  
*Game Interactions are things that trigger SFX, like character movement, hitting a spiky enemy, collecting a coin.*

- Sound List (SFX)
  - Swapping Tiles: the sound of tiles rubbing against each other
  - Scoring Points: coin collection sound
  - Completed Rows/Column: Mini Checkmark noise (like the duolingo sound)
  - Clicking/Hovering over Menu Items: Short click noises for auditory feedback
